# gender-ethnicity-age-data-set
the model tackles the Age Gender and Ethnicity from the kaggle dataset
the model predicts Age Gender and Ethnicity from Images
I use a multioutput model to tackle each output 
observations
when using a multioutput model it's better to not make the links to each output short it better to give each output their own set of weights to learn instead of each output corrupting the weights for the other outputs
